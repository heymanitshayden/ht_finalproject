*About*Protein Sequence Analysis by Unique Name is a simple bioinformatics tool which takes a protein sequence and supplies information about: protein length, molecular weight, net charge at pH 7,  and hydrophilic/hydrophobic residues. It’s intended purpose is to display concise details about proteins from the E.coli genome, Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. DH10B, which might be of some use to someone unfamiliar with existing bioinformatics tools. As it stands, this web application queries a MySQL database for proteins exclusively of this strain of E.coli. However, in the future, it is entirely possible for the database to be updated with other bacterial genomes for protein sequence analysis. *Requirements* This web application was developed using Mozilla Firefox version 66.0.3. User’s web browser should be up to date and able to handle HTML5 elements, to ensure this, it is suggested to NOT use Internet Explorer. *Database*This web application queries a MySQL database hosted on the back-end server. This is a relational database implementing the chado database schema details of the chado database schema can be found at: (http://www.gmod.org/wiki/Chado_-_Getting_Started). As stated, the database is currently loaded with an annotated genome from E.coli str.K-12 substr. DH10B. *Query Form* Traveling to: bfx.aap.jhu.edu/hthoma/final_project/unique_name_form   will bring you to the webpage to query the tool. In the search bar, you can enter a unique name identifier expected to be found in the E.coli genome. For more information on unique name identifiers please see: (http://www.gmod.org/wiki/Chado_-_Getting_Started) *CGI*After submission of the user side query form, the search term is sent to a CGI script on the back-end server, where it will perform a query within the supplied database. If the unique name searched hits an amino acid sequence, the CGI script will analyze that sequence displaying the sequence, the sequence length, the sequence molecular weight (units = Daltons), the net charge of the protein (at physiological pH, or, pH =7), and a string displaying each amino acid residue as hydrophilic (displayed as ‘H’) or hydrophobic (displayed as ‘h’).*Detailed Performance* Travel to the web application form site in your browser: bfx.aap.jhu.edu/hthoma25/final_project/unique_name_form.htmlIn the search bar, enter in an unique name identifier, without quotations marks. For guidance, the search bar should show a suggested unique name identifier for which the user can use as an example. After typing in an unique name identifier into the search bar, click “Submit”. No further actions are required, the protein analysis results should display on the user’s screen.
